# Spring XML Parsers

This is a project created to host multiple endpoints using Spring Framework.

Spring Boot was used to jumpstart development, but Spring Framework 5 libraries
were overridden in the pom.xml.

Currently, issue these commands to build/run:
mvn clean package
java -jar -Dserver.port=9000 target/spring-xml-parsers-0.1.0.war
